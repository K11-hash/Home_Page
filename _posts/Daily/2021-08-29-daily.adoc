== What Happened Today

== What I've Done Today

* submitted two requirements.
* installed google calendar to my blog

== Notice

* I can convert google tasks to google calendar event with zapier for free up to 50 tasks per month. It's great but I'm concerned that zapier takes costs even a little. It's need to find how to make tasks into event
for free with no restriction.

* microsoft automate not free.
